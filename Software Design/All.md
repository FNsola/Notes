# Role of a variable
**Variable has multiple purposes (logic less obvious) => easier to introduce bugs**
- Constant/Fixed Value  
  **Initialized without any calculation**  
  **Does not change thereafter**
- Stepper  
  **Stepping through values**  
  **Can be predicted**
- Most-recent holder (hold latest value)
- Gatherer (accumulator)
- One-way flag (boolean)
- Temporary (Holding very short period)
- Organizer  
  **Rearrange element after initialization**  
  **e.g list, array**
- Transformation (Gets new value with same calculation from another variable)
