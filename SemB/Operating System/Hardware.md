# Hardware
- Main Memory(RAM)  
  **A set of locations(sequentially numbered addresses) stores data and programs**  
  **Volatile (lost  when computer shut down)**
- Secondary Memory  
  **Provides large nonvolatile storage capacity**  
  **Store program and data files**
  - Magnetic disk (Surface divide into tracks, subdivide into sectors)
  - Magnetic Tape
  - Optical disk (Encodes binary data (bits) in the form of pits and lands)
  - USB flash drive
  - Mass storege device
- I/O Modules  
  **Moves data between the computer and the external environment**
- System Bus  
  **Communication among processors, main memory, and I/O modules**
- Program Counter(PC)  
  **Holds address of the next instruction to be fetched**
- Instruction Register(IR)  
  **Store fetched instruction**
- Accumulator(AC)  
  **Store execution result temporarily**
- Processor
  **Control Unit and Arithmetic & Logic Unit(ALU)**

  ## Type
  - Microprocessor  
  **Contains a processor on a single chip**
  - Multiprocessors  
  **Contains multiple processors(cores) on a single chip**
  - Graphical Processing Units(GPUs)
  **Single-Instruction Multiple Data(SIMD) techniques**  
  **efficient computation on arrays of data**
  - Digital Signal Processors(DSPs)
  **Encoding/decoding speech and video (codecs)**  
  **Provide support for encryption and security**
  - System on a Chip (Soc)
  **handheld devices**
