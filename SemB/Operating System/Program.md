# Program
- Uniprogramming - **Only one program is running at a given time**  
  > https://er.yuvayana.org/uniprogramming-and-multiprogramming-with-their-differences/

  | Advantage | Disadvantage |
  | --- | --- |
  | Small unit memory (easy design) | Waste CPU utilization |
  | Execute with minimal overhead | Compared to fundamental memory, disk memory has long access time |
  | No intrude (100% processorâ€™s time on application) |  |
  | Suitable for mbedded system |  |
- Multiprogramming - **More than one program to execute**

  | Advantage | Disadvantage |
  | --- | --- |
  | High CPU utilization | Require CPU scheduling |
  |  | Memory management (difficult design) |
- Parallel Programming - **Execute program same time**
